error <<-EOF
    Application not supported by this buildpack!

    The 'feryardiant/wpdev' buildpack is set on this application,
    but was unable to detect a WordPress codebase.

    A WordPress on Heroku requires a 'wp-cli.yml' at the root of
    the directory structure. If you are trying to deploy a
    WordPress site, ensure that file is present at the top level
    directory.

    If you are trying to deploy an application written in another
    language, you need to change the list of buildpacks set on your
    Heroku app using the 'heroku buildpacks' command.

    For more information, refer to the following documentation:
    https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks
